   git clone <repository-url>
   cd the-nerdy-network
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev --host
   # or
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The UI follows a "Polished Playground" design philosophy:

- **Clean & Modern**: Minimalist design with plenty of whitespace
- **Professional**: Business-ready aesthetics suitable for enterprise use
- **Playful**: Engaging elements that make the platform enjoyable
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant with proper contrast and navigation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices

## 🌐 Navigation Structure

The application uses React Router for client-side routing:

- `/` - Landing Page (Phase 1)
- `/jobs` - Job Board (Phase 2)
- `/community` - Community Platform (Phase 3)
- `/ecosystem` - Serendipity Engine (Phase 4)
- `/hub` - Network Hub (Phase 5)

## 🔌 API Integration

The UI is designed to work with RESTful APIs. See `API_ENDPOINTS.md` for complete API documentation including:

- Authentication endpoints
- Job board APIs
- Community management
- Project collaboration
- Real-time features via WebSocket

### Mock Data

Currently, all components use mock data for demonstration. To integrate with real APIs:

1. Replace mock data imports with API calls
2. Add proper error handling
3. Implement loading states
4. Add authentication context
5. Set up WebSocket connections for real-time features

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS classes can be modified in component files
- Global styles are in `src/App.css`
- Color scheme can be updated in Tailwind config

### Components
- All components are modular and reusable
- UI components from shadcn/ui can be customized
- Icons from Lucide React can be easily replaced

### Content
- Mock data can be found in each component file
- Text content can be updated directly in JSX
- Images should be placed in `src/assets/`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Deployment Options
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop build folder or connect repo
- **AWS S3**: Upload build files to S3 bucket with CloudFront
- **GitHub Pages**: Use GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file for environment-specific configuration:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.nerdynetwork.com
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://ws.nerdynetwork.com
```
